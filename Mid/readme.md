i use my [last semester's snake game](https://julianalidya.github.io/wp/Mid%20Term/index.html) as reference, but this time there's sign up and login function. there's also leaderboard to show each player rank based on their highscore!
as for the new code, i use chatgpt to help me debug.

here's some screenshot to understand the new updates of my snake game better
